#Razr ðŸ—¡

Simple and easy to use DI container for node.js

## Installation

To install the stable version:

```bash
npm install --save razr
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.
If you donâ€™t, you can access these files on [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com/razr/), download them, or point your package manager to them.


## Quick start

First of all you have to create a config file, describing your dependencies:

```js
{
  "Computer": {
    "class": "./Computer.js", // path to computer class file
    "args": ["RAM", "HDD", "CPU", "GPU"] // dependencies we want to inject
  },
  "RAM": {
    "class": "./RAM.js",
    "args": []
  },
  "HDD": {
    "class": "./HDD.js",
    "args": []
  },
  "CPU": {
    "class": "./CPU.js",
    "args": ["RAM"]
  },
  "GPU": {
    "class": "./GPU.js",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

**Note:**
the path you write in config should be relative to the entry point of your app
_(the file, where you `require` razr)_

So the `Computer` class should be like this:

```js
'use strict'

class Computer {
    constructor(ram, hdd, cpu, gpu) {
        this._cpu = cpu
        this._gpu = gpu
        this._hdd = hdd
        this._ram = ram
    }
}

module.exports = Computer
```

And finally you can get your `Computer` instance at ease:

```js

const Injector = require('razr')(__dirname, './path/to/your/config.json')

const computer = Injector.get('Computer')

```

**That's it**, simple and clear! ðŸ’¥
